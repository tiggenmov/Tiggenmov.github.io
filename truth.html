            <p class="intro">
                For more than 50 years, generation after generation of Tigrayan youth have endured systematic suffering under the Ethiopian state. 
                We were promised change, peace, and equality—but instead, we inherited cycles of repression, war, and targeted violence.
            </p>

                <div class="pillar">    
                    <h3>WE DEMAND TRUTH</h3>    
                    <p>We refuse silence. We seek full acknowledgment of the crimes committed against our people, without distortion, denial, or political manipulation.</p>    
                </div>    

                <div class="pillar">    
                    <h3>WE DEMAND PEACE</h3>    
                    <p>A peace built on justice, accountability, and the freedom for Tigray to determine its own future without fear or coercion.</p>

                    <h3>WE DEMAND REHABILITATION</h3>    
                    <p>Rebuilding our destroyed homeland—schools, hospitals, communities, identity, and future.  
                       Trauma healing, economic restoration, and support for survivors must be at the center.</p>

                    <h3>A GENERATION THAT SURVIVED</h3>    
                    <p>We grew up through siege, famine, digital blackout, and genocide. We carry both the scars and the determination to never allow this to happen again.</p>

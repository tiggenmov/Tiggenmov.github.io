            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p class="intro">
                We are the youth of Tigray — survivors, builders, witnesses, and leaders of a historic turning point.
                For 50 years, the Ethiopian state worked to weaken, divide, and break the spirit of Tigrayan youth.
                We grew up under discrimination, violence, structural suppression, and targeted injustice.
                But we are still standing — stronger, louder, and more united than ever.
            </p>

            <p class="intro">
                Tig Gen Mov is not just a movement. It is the voice of a generation that refuses to inherit silence or fear.
                We carry the responsibility to rebuild Tigray 2.0 — a sovereign, peaceful, innovative, and justice-centered nation built with our own hands.

    <!-- THE CAUSE -->
    <section class="youth-vision">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>The Cause We Stand For</h2>
            <p>
                Our movement is born from pain, truth, and unbroken hope.  
                We represent a generation that refuses to be erased or silenced.  
                We rise because Tigray deserves a future free from cycles of suffering.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                For decades, governments worked to weaken, divide, and oppress Tigrayan youth.  
                We lived with discrimination, violence, and deliberate injustice.  
                But we carry a new vision — a Tigray where the youth lead, heal, innovate, and rebuild.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                We demand:  
                • Truth over propaganda  
                • Peace rooted in justice  
                • Rehabilitation for survivors  
                • A sovereign future  
                • A youth-led national renaissance  
            </p>

            <br>

            <p><strong>We are the generation that will build Tigray’s future — not in fear, but in power.</strong></p>

            <h1>THE YOUTH OF TIGRAY</h1>
            <p class="tagline">We are the generation that refuses silence. We build Tigray 2.0.</p>
            <p class="mission">Tig Gen Mov is a generational movement led by the youth of Tigray — united to rebuild our future, reclaim our dignity, and define our destiny.</p>

    <!-- ABOUT THE MOVEMENT -->
    <section class="pillars">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p class="intro">
                We are the new generation of Tigray — survivors, thinkers, activists, builders, creators, defenders. 
                We inherit not only the pain of the past but also the responsibility to build a future that our parents were denied.
                Tig Gen Mov stands for generational justice, collective power, and the right of every Tigrayan youth to shape the next Tigray.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Leading Principles</h2>
            <div class="pillar-grid">

                <div class="pillar">
                    <h3>1. Youth Leadership</h3>
                    <p>We believe the youth must lead the political, social, economic, and cultural future of Tigray. No one decides our destiny except us.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="pillar">
                    <h3>2. Generational Responsibility</h3>
                    <p>We are responsible for building Tigray 2.0 — a peaceful, sovereign, thriving nation created by and for the next generation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="pillar">
                    <h3>3. Right to Rebuild</h3>
                    <p>The youth of Tigray have the right to rebuild what was destroyed — our communities, institutions, identity, and future.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="pillar">
                    <h3>4. Truth & Justice</h3>
                    <p>Our movement stands on truth. The crimes committed against our people must be exposed, documented, and never denied again.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="pillar">
                    <h3>5. Freedom & Sovereignty</h3>
                    <p>A free future is a safe future. We fight for a sovereign Tigray where our people can live without fear or oppression.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="pillar">
                    <h3>6. Peace Through Accountability</h3>
                    <p>There can be no peace without justice. We work for healing, rehabilitation, and the right of survivors to be heard.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="pillar">
                    <h3>7. Innovation & Future Thinking</h3>
                    <p>Tigray must rise through creativity, technology, education, and modern nation-building — led by the youth.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="pillar">
                    <h3>8. Unity of Tegaru</h3>
                    <p>We stand together across the world — Tigray, diaspora, refugees, survivors — united by identity, purpose, and hope.</p>

    <!-- THE CAUSE -->

        <div class="container">
            <h2>The Cause We Stand For</h2>
            <p class="intro">
                Our cause is simple: the youth of Tigray deserve a future free from oppression.  
                We rise because we carry the scars of genocide, the weight of injustice, and the vision of a better nation.

                    <h3>End Generational Suffering</h3>
                    <p>For 50+ years, Tigrayan youth have been targeted by systems of violence and discrimination. We refuse to inherit that suffering.</p>

                    <h3>Ending Silence</h3>
